# UPC Counter

## Evaluator Pitch
Counting inventory manually is a pain, especailly at BYU Football. With an wide array of different styles, sizes, and colors it is taxing to keep track of all the different items and not miscount items. The UPC Counter app makes this process easy by utilizing the UPC codes that are on the items tags. The app takes in a UPC code and then adds that to the count of that item. After entering the desired items the user will then be able to view a list of all the total counts confident that each item was accounted for properly.
