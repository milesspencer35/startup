# UPC Counter

## Specifications

### Evaluator Pitch
Counting inventory manually is a pain, especially at BYU Football. With a wide array of different styles, sizes, and colors it is taxing to keep track of all the different items and not miscount items. The UPC Counter app makes this process easy by utilizing the UPC codes that are on the item's tags. The app takes in a UPC code and then adds that to the count of that item. After entering the desired items the user will then be able to view a list of all the total counts confident that each item was accounted for properly.

## Technologies
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

* HTML - This will be the layout of the 3 webpages. It will include text, input files, and buttons. 
* CSS - Make sure the website formats well on desktop and phone sizes. This will also create correct padding, colors, and font. 
* JavaScript - Provides login, adding a UPC item, adding a brand new item, and editing item information.
* Service - Backend service for login, adding new items, and retrieving item info.
* DB/Login - Input box and submit box for login. The database will hold items and their information. Once a user inputs a UPC code that is stored in the database that info will be sent to the client. 
* WebSocket - Sends a notification when someone enters a brand new item with info. 
* React - Application ported to use the React web framework.

## HTML deliverable

➡️ The following is an example of the required information for the `Startup HTML` deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

**HTML Pages** - 3 HTML pages that represent login, counting items, and a list of inventory items
**Links** - After login you are linked to counting items. You can navigate between the counting and inventory pages. Log out takes you back to login page.
**Text** - Count is represented in table of text. Inventory is represented as table of text. 
**Images** - Barcode logo is present in the header of each page.
**DB** - Tables of inventory will be generated by data pulled from data base.
**Login** - Input box, password box, and submit button for login.
**3rd Party Service Call** - This will either be the Disify to valididate the email of the user or a Yo Moma joke generated when the 'Tell me a Yo Mama Joke' button that is on the footer of the inventory List page.
**WebSocket** - When someone adds a new item it shows up in the recently added item.
